## When, where

The weekly triage meeting is held on [Zulip] at [11:30 US Eastern time on every other Monday][everytimezone].
For the date of the next triage meeting, see the [meetings page].

## So you want to fix a bug?

If you're interested in fixing bugs, there is no need to wait for the triage meeting.
Take a look at the [mentored async-await bugs that have no assignee][bugs].
Every mentored bug should have a few comments.
If you see one you like, you can add the `@rustbot claim` comment into the bug and start working on it!
Feel to reach out to the mentor on [Zulip] to ask questions.

## Project board

The [project board] tracks various bugs and other work items for the async foundation group.
It is used to drive the triage process.

## Triage process

In our weekly triage meetings, we take new issues assigned [`A-async-await`] and categorize them.
The process is:

- Review the [project board], from right to left:
  - Look at what got **Done**, and celebrate! :tada:
  - Review **In progress** issues to check we are making progress and there is a clear path to finishing (otherwise, move to the appropriate column)
  - Review **Blocked** issues to see if there is anything we can do to unblock
  - Review **Claimed** issues to see if they are in progress, and if the assigned person still intends to work on it
  - Review **To do** issues and assign to anyone who wants to work on something
- Review [uncategorized issues]
  - Mark `P-low`, `P-medium`, or `P-high`
  - Add `P-high` and _assigned_ `E-needs-mentor` issues to the [project board]
  - Mark `AsyncAwait-triaged`
- If there's still a shortage of **To do** issues, review the list of [`P-medium`] or [`P-low`] issues for candidates

## Mentoring

If an issue is a good candidate for mentoring, mark `E-needs-mentor` and try to find a mentor.

Mentors assigned to issues should write up mentoring instructions.
**Often, this is just a couple lines pointing to the relevant code.**
Mentorship doesn't require intimate knowledge of the compiler, just some familiarity and a willingness to look around for the right code.

After writing instructions, mentors should un-assign themselves, add `E-mentor`, and remove `E-needs-mentor`.
On the project board, if a mentor is assigned to an issue, it should go to the **Claimed** column until mentoring instructions are provided.
After that, it should go to **To do** until someone has volunteered to work on it.

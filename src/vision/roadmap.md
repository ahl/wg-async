# Roadmap

What follows is a list of *high-level goals*, like "async fn everywhere", that capture some part of the improved user experience. Each goal has associated *initiatives*, which are particular streams of work within that goal. Each goal and each initiative have an associated owner -- in some cases multiple owners -- who are the people responsible for ensuring that the goal/initiative is making progress. If you click on a goal/initiative, you will get a high-level description of its *impact*. That is, how the experience of using async Rust is going to change as a result of this work.

We categorize the goals and initiatives into four states:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ | Done. |
| 🦀  | In progress: Work is ongoing! |
| ✋ | Help wanted: Seeking an [owner] to pursue this! Talk to the [wg leads] if you are interested. |
| 💤 | Paused: we are waiting to work on this until some other stuff gets done. |

Some goals and initiatives have further "how to help" instructions for those wanting to contribute.
These are marked by the 🛠️ symbol.

[owner]: ./how_to_vision/owners.md

## Impact and milesetones

Clicking on active initiatives also shows a list of *milestones*. These milestones (things like "write an [evaluation doc]") indicate the planned work ahead of us. We meet every 2 weeks to assess our progress on these milestones and to update the list as needed.

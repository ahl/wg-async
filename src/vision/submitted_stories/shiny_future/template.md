# âœ¨ Shiny future stories: template

*This is a template for adding new "shiny future" stories. To propose a new shiny future PR, do the following:*

* *Create a new file in the [`shiny_future`] directory named something like `Alan_loves_foo.md` or `Grace_does_bar_and_its_great.md`, and start from [the raw source from this template]. You can replace all the italicized stuff. :)*
* *Do not add a link to your story to the [`SUMMARY.md`] file; we'll do it after merging, otherwise there will be too many conflicts.*

*For more detailed instructions, see the [How To Vision: Shiny Future] page!*

## ðŸš§ Warning: Draft status ðŸš§

This is a draft "shiny future" story submitted as part of the brainstorming period. It is derived from what actual Rust users wish async Rust should be, and is meant to deal with some of the challenges that Async Rust programmers face today.

If you would like to expand on this story, or adjust the answers to the FAQ, feel free to open a PR making edits (but keep in mind that, as peoples needs and desires for async Rust may differ greatly, shiny future stories [cannot be wrong]. At worst they are only useful for a small set of people or their problems might be better solved with alternative solutions). Alternatively, you may wish to [add your own shiny vision story][htvsq]!

## The story

*Write your story here! Feel free to add subsections, citations, links, code examples, whatever you think is best.*

## ðŸ¤” Frequently Asked Questions

*NB: These are generic FAQs. Feel free to customize them to your story or to add more.*

### What status quo stories are you retelling?

*Link to status quo stories if they exist. If not, that's ok, we'll help find them.*

### What are the key attributes of this shiny future?

*Summarize the main attributes of the design you were trying to convey.*

### What is the "most shiny" about this future?

*Thing about Rust's core "value propositions": performance, safety and correctness, productivity. Which benefit the most relative to today?*

### What are some of the potential pitfalls about this future?

*Thing about Rust's core "value propositions": performance, safety and correctness, productivity. Are any of them negatively impacted? Are there specific application areas that are impacted negatively? You might find the sample [projects] helpful in this regard, or perhaps looking at the goals of each [character].*

### Did anything surprise you when writing this story? Did the story go any place unexpected?

*The act of writing shiny future stories can uncover things we didn't expect to find. Did you have any new and exciting ideas as you were writing? Realize some complications that you didn't foresee?*

### What are some variations of this story that you considered, or that you think might be fun to write? Have any variations of this story already been written?

*Often when writing stories, we think about various possibilities. Sketch out some of the turning points here -- maybe someone will want to turn them into a full story! Alternatively, if this is a variation on an existing story, link back to it here.*

### What are some of the things we'll have to figure out to realize this future? What projects besides Rust itself are involved, if any? (Optional)

*Often the 'shiny future' stories involve technical problems that we don't really know how to solve yet. If you see such problems, list them here!*
